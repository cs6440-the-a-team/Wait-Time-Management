Wait Time Management

### Description
So far this repository is just a bunch of stubs for future features and making sure we are comfortable with the way that docker works.

### Setup
Run `docker-compose up`

### Usage
Go to `localhost/` in a browser.

You can also look at the backend services, i.e. - `localhost:8080/waitingroom`
