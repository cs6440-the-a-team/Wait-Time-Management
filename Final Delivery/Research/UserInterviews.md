# Additional Comments
Our mentors can be considered within the Department Staff user group. We were unable to directly interview other end user types of the application for this project due to constraints in time, location, availability and privacy converns. Ideally we would have loved to interview all end user types to gain their insights and incorporate them into the software.
We can consider this first build of the application a prototype that can then be taken to the other potential end users after an interview to gain their insihgts and opinions.
